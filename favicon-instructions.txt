FAVICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

To complete the setup of your website for GitHub Pages, you need to generate favicon files.

1. Visit a favicon generator website like:
   - https://favicon.io/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/

2. Create a favicon with the letter "T" or a symbol representing Tajweed learning

3. Download the generated files and place them in the root directory of your project:
   - favicon.ico
   - favicon-16x16.png
   - favicon-32x32.png
   - apple-touch-icon.png
   - android-chrome-192x192.png
   - android-chrome-512x512.png

4. These files are referenced in your HTML and site.webmanifest files, so make sure the filenames match exactly.

5. After adding these files, your website will have a proper favicon that appears in browser tabs and when bookmarked.

Note: You can delete this instruction file before uploading to GitHub.
